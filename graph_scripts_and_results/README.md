In this folder all the codes used to make paper plots are listed. There may be differences in font sizes due to readability.
The results from MHIMS are loaded and cannot be evaluated from this repo. Comsol Results must be manually extracted from comsol (more info in COMSOL files introductory message). Festim results are automatically updated when -py scripts are run in the Festim_models folder.
